Part A: Data

1.1 Data Preparation: where did we get the data?

Raw Data:

●	Hotel: https://www.programmableweb.com/news/10-top-apis-hotels/brief/2019/09/08
●	Airbnb: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html
●	Hotel properties:https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Hotels-Properties-Citywide/tjus-cn27
●	Restaurant: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/restaurant-data-set-2/f6tk-2b7a

Cleaned Data:
All cleaned data is in the Project Data Clean folder. (10 csv datasets in total)

1.2 Data Cleaning and transformation: 

1.	All data are in csv format
2.	Cleaning process:
a.	Use OpenRefine and Excel to cluster and clean excessive and repetitive rows. 
b.	Use Python to drop unnecessary columns and conduct a normalization process. See python files
i.	‘NY Airbnb & NY hotel Clean Steps.html’  for normalization process (in Script Folder) 
ii.	‘Hotel_properties_clean.html’ (in Script Folder).

1.3 Data Storing

1.	Export from OpenRefine in csv file. 
2.	Load data into SQL using import wizard.
3.	Load data into GCP for data storage and future collaboration use. 
4.	Load data into MongoDB using terminal common lines. 
5.	Load data into Neo4j using ‘Neo4j.docx’ (In Script Folder). 

In SQL:
●	Created schema called ‘hotel’
●	Create database using the SQL file ‘SQL Data Import.sql’ (In Script Folder)
●	Used SQL queries to generate insights (in BI Folder)	
In MongoDB
●	Created schema called ‘NYDB’ using file ‘Mongo DB Data import.txt’ (in Script Folder).
●	Used MongoDB queries to generate insights (in BI Folder).
	
	
1.4 Visualization & Models

Tableau: Connect SQL server to Tableau 
●	Workbook ‘Data Visualization.twbx’ (in BI Folder)
SQL:
●	Used SQL queries to generate insights (in BI Folder)	
MongoDB
●	Used MongoDB queries to generate insights (in BI Folder).
R
●	Used R to generate text cloud, r file ‘text-analysis.html’ (in BI Folder). 
●	Used R to generate linear regression, logistic regression, random forest model ‘R-Analysis.html’ (in BI Folder).
